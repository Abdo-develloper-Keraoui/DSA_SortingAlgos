# DSA_SortingAlgos
This program contains the implementation of 5 sorting algorithms in c that belong to two different categories:
                - comparison-based sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort (really slow, aka average and worst cases of time complexities of O(n^2))
                - divide and conquer algorithms: QuickSort(using the Lomuto partition scheme) and Merge Sort (faster for large data sets both with average cases of O(n log(n)) )
